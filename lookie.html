      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        LookieUp is an app which aims towards helping users find events based on their interests.
        Unlike competitors the idea was to create a platform where anybody could create an event
        and promote it. Most event listings today are added by staff writers, I wanted this platform to
        be populated by users and event organizers.

      <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
      <p>
        To begin my research, I focused on a few competitors or similar platforms,
        analysing UI, UX, User flow, IA and key features. Competetive analysis along with
        app store user reviews on the competitors helped
        in getting a better understanding on what key features should be added or subtracted.
        <br>
        <br>
        User Interviews gave me an insight into consumer behaviour, their pain points,
        requirements and motivations. Some key features of this app like
        hosting event for anyone, organizers inviting active users -
        were a result of these user interviews.

      <h2>Empathy Map</h2>
      <p>
        Mapped out a scenario about how currently the user goes about facing the problem.
        This process helped me decide how the appâ€™s user experience might be designed
        to fit in with the event searching routine. Rather than concentrating on what the issue is
        or what the clients need, I wondered why they needed it. By understanding why
        individuals may need this application it expanded my odds of making a genuinely significant impact.

      <h2>Persona</h2>
      <p>
        The next step was to answer the most important question - "Who am I desiging for"?
        Since the goal was to design user centric produts it was essential to get a deep
        understanding of our target audience their motivations and requirements. I charted
        out character traits, behaviours of our potential users. Two of the personas exhibited
        edge cases since they depended on specific needs of a portion of the members.

      <h2>User Flow</h2>
      <p>
        At this point I had a vague idea of how the app will function.
        Mapping out the user flow helped in visualizing the number of steps a user needs to
        complete specific tasks. It also gave an insight into the architecture of the app.

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Once I had a clear vision of all the required screens I began translating them into rough sketches.
        I started out with the classic pen and paper route. Drawing boxes out helped in getting a better
        understanding of different layouts. I later converted them into low - fidelty Wireframes
        using Sketch.

      <h2>Design + Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        After finalizing wireframes, I created a style guide which I could use as reference. It helped
        keeping things symmetric and also make the design process much faster. The final design was made
        in Sketch with the prototyping done in Invision. You can see the final app below.
